;;; Commentary:

;; yaml-pro contains a new mode which provides conveniences when
;; editing YAML.  Running `yaml-pro-mode' switches the mode and the
;; following commands are available: `yaml-pro-move-subtree-up',
;; `yaml-pro-next-subtree', `yaml-pro-prev-subtree',
;; `yaml-pro-kill-subtree', `yaml-pro-up-level',
;; `yaml-pro-unfold-at-point', and `yaml-pro-fold-at-point'.
