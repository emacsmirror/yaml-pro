# yaml-pro: tools for editing YAML leveraging a parser

![screenshot](./docs/screenshot1.gif)

yaml-pro is a package that provides conveniences for editing yaml.  It
utilizes the YAML parser at https://github.com/zkry/yaml.el to obtain
a parse tree and is then able to do things like move between subtrees,
delete entire sections of YAML (even if it's written in JSON style),
and swap subtrees.

# Installation

This package is not yet on MELPA so you will have to install it
locally.  **Make sure that you have YAML on the latest version** and
add yaml-pro.el to your load path.

# Usage

Run the command `yaml-pro-mode` to initialize the mode. From there you
have the following commands available (with default keybindings).

- **yaml-pro-kill-subtree** (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>C-w</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-up-level** (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-u</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-next-subtree** (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-n</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-prev-subtree** (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-p</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-fold-at-point** (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-c</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-unfold-at-point** (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-o</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-move-subtree-up** (<kbd>s-up</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-move-subtree-down** (<kbd>s-down</kbd>)
- **yaml-pro-edit-scalar** (<kbd>C-c '</kbd>)
  - (use prefix argument <kbd>C-u</kbd> to supply an initialization
    command to set major mode)

*The default bindings are subject to change as this package is in beta*

# Roadmap

- [x] Edit yaml values in separate buffer (like org-edit-special)
  - [x] block options for how to store the string.
  - [ ] save default init command on a path basis
- [ ] Async parsing: preemptively parse document for faster editing
      (perhaps via idle timer).
- [ ] Tools to work with various template modes.  Go-templated YAML is
      very common but greatly hinders the effectiveness of tools like
      LSP.  Is there something that could be done (even if it's kind
      of hacky) to alleviate this?

# Contributing

Have a suggestion for this package? Feel free to create an issue. I'd
love to hear others pain-points when editing YAML.
